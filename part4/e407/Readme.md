# Exercise 4.07: GitOpsify Cluster

Followed the example, in this repo: https://github.com/rvl-q/dwk-kube-cluster

`hashgenerator` appeared, but did not go away without delering it in the cluster.

Did not try to "fluxify" Prometheus, Loki & Grafana (at least yet), if that was whar we were supposed to do?
